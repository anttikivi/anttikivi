# Hello, I’m _Antti Kivi_

I’m communications adviser at the
[National Union of University Students in Finland](https://syl.fi/en), managing
director for @visiosto, and a student of social sciences and science at the
University of Helsinki and administrative sciences at Tampere University. You
can read more about me on my website at
[www.anttikivi.fi](https://www.anttikivi.fi/en/) (as soon as I get around to
updating it).

Right now I’m mostly working on @visiosto’s projects as well as server and
developer tooling.
