# Hello, I’m _Antti Kivi_

I’m communications adviser at the
[National Union of University Students in Finland](https://syl.fi/en), managing
director and developer for [Visiosto](https://www.visiosto.fi/en/), and a
student of social sciences and science at the University of Helsinki and
administrative sciences at Tampere University. You can read more about me on my
website at [www.anttikivi.fi](https://www.anttikivi.fi/en/) (as soon as I get
around to updating it).

Right now I’m mostly working on [Visiosto’s](https://github.com/visiosto)
projects as well as server and developer tooling.
