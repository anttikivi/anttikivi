Hello, I’m _Antti Kivi_.

I’m a software developer, entrepreneur, student, and communications adviser.

As an entrepreneur at [Visiosto](https://www.visiosto.fi/en), I build web applications. Besides that, I mostly work on open-source projects, and you can find some of my work here on GitHub.

My day job revolves around politics and social issues as the communications adviser of [National Union of University Students in Finland](https://syl.fi/en).

In addition to all this, I study social sciences and science at the University of Helsinki and administrative sciences at Tampere University.
