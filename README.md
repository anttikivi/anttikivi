Hello, I’m _Antti Kivi_.

I build web applications as an entrepreneur at
[Visiosto](https://www.visiosto.fi/en). We specialize in accessible applications
and inclusive services.

In my spare time, I mainly work on personal projects, most of which are open
source. You can find some of my work here on GitHub.

You can read more about me on my [website](https://www.anttikivi.com).

For my day job, I’m the communications adviser at the
[National Union of University Students in Finland](https://syl.fi/en).
